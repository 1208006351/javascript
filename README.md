# JavaScript, aka. Web ECMAScript

This is the repository for [the JavaScript spec](http://javascript.spec.whatwg.org/). This specification used to document the differences between the [ECMAScript specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) and the compatibility and interoperability requirements for ECMAScript implementations in web browsers.

Nowadays its contents have been upstreamed into ECMAScript, Annex B. The remaining web compatibility issues are tracked here: <https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/labels/web%20reality>.

See [“Sunsetting the JavaScript Standard”](https://blog.whatwg.org/javascript) for more information.
